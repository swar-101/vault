# Brahmi Script Origins: Paakit, Not Sanskrit

1. Aśokan Edicts (ca. 250 BCE) 
	- The earliest physical attestations of Brahmi writing are Emperor Aśoka's rock-edicts, c. 250 BCE, at location ??.
2. Junagadh Rock Inscription, c. 150 CE, near Girnar Hill, near Junagadh, Gujarat, India.

Firstly let's understand the advent of modern day languages like Marathi and Hindi from the Paakit Script.

It's evident that modern day Marathi and Hindi are written in Devanagri.

#claim💭

“Panini himself cataloged a language **already in flux**—with clear Prakrit substrata. If Sanskrit were truly older and purer, he’d have _no_ need to define or restrict Prakrit forms so extensively."

#position 
The intention behind this claim is not to falsify the origin of Sanskrit but clearly distinguish Sanskrit being old as a normative claim from medieval compilers, not an objective archaeological fact. 


#proofs

## 1. Nanaghat Inscriptions

#point
These are the early depictions of the Brahmi (Bambhi) script.
The Sanskrit on the other hand cannot be fully expressed in Brahmi (Bambhi) script as the religious contexts like the [[Rigveda]] emphasize on tonal accents like udatta, anudatta, svarit.

# Sanskrit 

Sanskrit is often portrayed as the _oldest language_, most of its **documented use** is from **later periods**, especially in **elite and religious contexts**.


Traditional Brahmanical sources sometimes place Pāṇini in the **3rd century BCE** (to align him with King Aśoka), but majority of linguists date him to **c. 6th–4th century BCE** based on internal references (the names of Yavana kings, Prakritisms in his sutras, etc.).
# Pali

Pāli, Ardhamāgadhī, and other Prākrits were the **languages of the masses** — recorded in **actual inscriptions** like **Ashokan edicts (3rd century BCE)**.

These languages are **simpler**, more **phonetically natural**, and **closer to speech** — hallmarks of authentic, early linguistic stages.
