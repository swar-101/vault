## Debunking the Claim: Looting and Raping happened during Shivaji's kingship during Bargi Invasion

## 1. Shivaji's Code of Conduct

- Shivaji followed a strict moral and military code that **forbade harm to women**, destruction of religious places, and the looting of innocents.
- ‚úÖ *Primary Source*: **Sabhasad Bakhar (1697)**  

  > "Tell your Nawab that Shivaji does not fight with women. We seek kingdoms, not women."
  - üìò **Source**: G.S. Sardesai, *Shivaji the Great*, Vol I, pp. 160‚Äì162.

- ‚úÖ *Persian Records*: Even hostile Mughal chronicler **Khafi Khan** acknowledged that Shivaji spared civilians and respected women.
  - üìò Source: *Muntakhab-al Lubab* (summarized in Sarkar‚Äôs *Shivaji and His Times*, Appendix C).
  
- ‚úÖ *Jedhe Shakawali*: Records multiple instances of Shivaji punishing his own men for excesses during raids.


## 2. Shivaji ‚â† Bargis

- The **Bargi raids in Bengal** occurred between **1741‚Äì1751**, **over 60 years after Shivaji‚Äôs death (1680)**.
- These invasions were led by **Peshwa-appointed commanders**, not by Shivaji or Sambhaji.
- Mostly under commanders like Malharrao Holkar and Ranoji Shinde, **not Shivaji or Sambhaji**.
- Atrocities like rape, burning, and mutilation are recorded in:
  - **Maharashtra Purana** by Gangaram (1745‚Äì50) ‚Äî poetic, not eyewitness.
  - **Chitrachampu** by Vaneshwar Vidyalankar ‚Äî Mughal-court aligned.
- These accounts are **not contemporaneous with Shivaji**, and carry **clear political and poetic bias.**

#### What Were the Bargi Raids?

- A series of fast cavalry attacks by Maratha forces to extract **chauth (tax)** from Bengal's Nawabs.
- Conducted under **Peshwa Baji Rao I's administration**, particularly during Alivardi Khan‚Äôs rule in Bengal.
- Notoriously remembered in Bengali folklore and poetry for their cruelty and destruction.

### Problem with these Historical Attributions

- Sources such as:
    - _Maharashtra Purana_ by Gangaram (1740s)
    - _Chitrachampu_ by Vaneshwar Vidyalankar (Mughal court writer)  

Describe atrocities such as rape and arson‚Äîbut:
- These are poetic, literary, or politically motivated.	
- Not eyewitness or state records.
- Written decades after Shivaji's death, and in a different region of the subcontinent.


## 3. Where the Allegations Come From 

- **Jadunath Sarkar**, in *Fall of the Mughal Empire*, Volume 1, references the above sources to describe atrocities during Bargi raids.
- He does **not accuse Shivaji directly**, but modern misreadings connect the dots incorrectly.
- **Portuguese colonial accounts** accuse **Sambhaji**, but are rooted in religious-political propaganda during the Goa campaign.
- None of these sources show **Shivaji himself** ordering or endorsing rape or indiscriminate looting.


## 4. Reinforcing Contemporary Evidence  

- **Abb√© Carr√©**, a French traveler, wrote in the 1670s:

  > "He [Shivaji] is admired for his moderation. His soldiers never insult women."
  - üìò Source: Abb√© Carr√©, *Voyage des Indes Orientales m√™l√© de plusieurs histoires curieuses* (1699), as quoted in secondary sources

---
‚ö†Ô∏èTo do: Awaiting for Digital Primary Source 
	Consulting:  
- A printed copy of _Voyage des Indes Orientales_ (first edition, 1699).
- Colonial-era archives or major libraries with rare manuscript collections.
- University or specialist historians who've done archival work on French travelogues from the 17th century.
---

- **East India Company records** from the Surat raid indicate:
    - **Precise economic targeting** of wealthy merchants and ports.
    - **No reference to rape, mass civilian killings, or religious violence**.
        
- **Historians like**:
    - Stewart Gordon (in _The Marathas 1600‚Äì1818_),
    - Setu Madhav Pagadi (_Chhatrapati Shivaji_),
    - G.S. Sardesai (_Shivaji the Great_)  
        all document that Shivaji:
        - Maintained ethical warfare.
        - Showed religious tolerance.
        - Enforced discipline among his troops.

## Debunking the Claim: Shivaji Looted Wodeyar at Srirangapatna

### Proven Error: No Primary Maratha Source Supports It

- **Sabhasad Bakhar**‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØWritten in 1697 by a close court historian, this is the most authoritative contemporary account of Shivaji‚Äôs campaigns [talageri.blogspot.com+12en.wikipedia.org+12munotes.in+12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabhasad_Bakhar?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    
    - It details Shivaji‚Äôs deeds, forts, political decisions, and military actions‚Äîin great depth.
    - There is **no mention** of any expedition to **Srirangapatna**, let alone looting Raja Wodeyar.
        
- **91-Kalami Bakhar** and **Tarikh-i-Shivaji**‚ÄØ‚Äî‚ÄØOther near-contemporary chronicles covering Shivaji‚Äôs life and governance.
    - None narrate or hint at an attack on **Raja Wodeyar** in **Srirangapatna** or any tribute campaign in that region during Shivaji‚Äôs lifetime.

### What Did Actually Happen: Sambhaji, Not Shivaji

- The **Maratha‚ÄìMysore War of 1682** occurred **two years after Shivaji‚Äôs death**, led by **Sambhaji**.

    - It ended in a treaty at **Srirangapatna** where **Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar** paid tribute to Sambhaji‚Äînot Shivaji.
    
    - That treaty is recorded in Mysore court records and later historians like **Hayavadana Rao** reference it [edurev.in+1historyoptional.in+1](https://edurev.in/t/264813/UPSC-Mains-Answer-PYQ-2020-History-Paper-1--Section-B-?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[vedantu.com+1en.wikipedia.org+1](https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/it-was-written-by-krishnaji-amant-sabhasad-class-12-social-science-cbse-5fca0ef9c7a4213431b049fb?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[penguin.co.in](https://www.penguin.co.in/what-really-happened-during-tipu-sultans-reign/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[reddit.com+4en.wikipedia.org+4talageri.blogspot.com+4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha%E2%80%93Mysore_War_%281682%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[talageri.blogspot.com](https://talageri.blogspot.com/2023/03/shivaji-as-hindu-counterpart-of.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

- This tribute is **frequently misattributed** to Shivaji in secondary or nationalist writings‚Äîbut the timeline firmly places it under Sambhaji‚Äôs campaigns.
