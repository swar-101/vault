In most Java classes, fields can be roughly categorized into two types:

1. Identity fields (a.k.a. business keys or natural keys)
	- These fields uniquely identify an object.
	- Examples: `id`, `email`, `username`, `SSN`, `phoneNumber` , etc.
	- These are usually stable and don't change once set.
	- They're often used in `equals()` and `hashCode()` implementations.
	
2. State fields (a.k.a. mutable properties)
	- These fields represent changing state of an object.
	- Examples: `isActive`, `hasPet`, `accountBalance`, `address`, etc.
	- These fields can change over time and should not be used for `hashCode()` and `equals()` unless you are 100% certain.



Let's understand this through an example:
