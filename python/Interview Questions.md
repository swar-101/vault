Q1. What is the difference between a module and a package in Python? 

A:

A module is a single file in Python which contains code. 
It can contain a combination of functions, classes and variables. 
These members can be imported and used in other programs.

A package on the other hand is a folder containing multiple related modules, usually with an `__init__.py` file that allows Python to treat the folder as a package. 
Modules help break code into manageable files while packages help us organize these modules into a hierarchy. 

Knowing the difference between modules and packages helps in structuring Python projects clearly and makes code reusable and maintainable.

2. What are the **built-in types** available in Python? 

Answer: 
Built-in types in Python are predefined data type types provided by the language. They fall into two categories: 
1. **mutable types**, which can be **changed after creation**, such as,
	- lists
	- sets
	- dictionaries

2. **immutable types**, which cannot be altered once created,
	- strings
	- tuples
	- numbers

Understanding this distinction is important because it affects how data is stored and manipulated. 
These types **form the foundation for working with data** in Python.

3. What is lambda function in Python? 

Answer: 
A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword that can take any number of arguments but contains only one expression. 

It's often used for short, throwaway functions, especially as arguments to higher order functions like map or filter. 
For example, 

```python
lambda x, y: x + y
```

returns the sum of two values. 


Lambdas help write concise and readable to code when a full function definition isn't necessary.
