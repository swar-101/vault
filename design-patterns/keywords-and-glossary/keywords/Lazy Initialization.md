## Analogy

In other words—you don't pay the cost upfront.
You wait until someone rings your doorbell before you brew up that coffee! ☕ 

This approach is like have a sous-chef who only starts cooking when you actually order a dish, saving energy and avoiding unnecessary preparation if you change your mind later. 👨‍🍳
